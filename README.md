We both attend Madison Academic. The idea for the website was a online store that sold products you can't find anywhere else. The name came from one of us saying the word "funky" and absolutely loving it. We then build the name around it. The concept was fairly simple and we came up with the layout rather quickly. We focused on layout and structure more than the content of the website. This was only the trial run of the website. We are planning to add a working checkout and more products in the next update.
